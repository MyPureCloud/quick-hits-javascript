## Genesys Cloud related Integration Custom Credentials:

The Genesys Cloud Platform API examples expect some custom credentials at the Genesys Function Data Actions integration level:
* GC_CLIENT_ID: The Client ID of your Client Credentials OAuth Client
* GC_CLIENT_SECRET: The Client Secret of your Client Credentials OAuth Client
* GC_REGION: the region of your Genesys Cloud org (e.g. mypurecloud.com, mypurecloud.ie)

You can find examples with different approaches for the HTTP client: axios and Genesys Cloud Platform API SDK for javascript.  
They are equivalent. It is to illustrate that you can pick the SDK you find the most convenien for your development.
